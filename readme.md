## Using a shortest path search to design mutagenic primers

Some time ago, I was planning some experiments to correlate chemical activity with the 3D structure of a few P450 BM3 mutants. T
here are about 70 BM3 structures on the PDB, but I was only interested in the substrate-bound ones, since this enzyme changes
shape quite a lot when it binds to a substrate and I wanted to cut down the search space a little.
